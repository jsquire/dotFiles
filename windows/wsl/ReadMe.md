# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### Overview

Included in this section are the artifacts and references used for building and configuring WSL instances across multiple Linux distributions.

In some cases, the artifacts may be a subset of functionality, requiring use in a specific way or order to be helpful, where others may be a fully automated and self-contained process.  Please remember that these were written for practical personal use and are not intended to be examples of best practice, nor polished and production-ready.
