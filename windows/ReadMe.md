# Windows

### Overview

Included in this section are the artifacts and references used for building and configuring a Windows desktop machine intended for general, development, and gaming use.

In some cases, the artifacts may be a subset of functionality, requiring use in a specific way or order to be helpful, where others may be a fully automated and self-contained process.  Please remember that these were written for practical personal use and are not intended to be examples of best practice, nor polished and production-ready.

### Structure

* **cli**  
  _Authored over a period of time starting in the mid-2000s, herein are a collection of utilities and small scripts intended to be called as by the Windows command line as part of the path.  (It is quite likely that some of these are stale and/or should be pruned.)_
 
* **git-bash**  
  _Authored over a period of time starting in roughly 2012, these are the $HOME items for the bash profile associated with the Git for Windows environment._
  
* **settings**  
  _Authored over a long period of time, starting in the mid-2000s, these are a collection of miscellaneous settings and configuration-related assets._  
  
* **wsl**  
  _Originally authored in 2016, and revised over time, this is a container for the assets associated with building and configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux environment, targeting an Ubuntu distribution._
